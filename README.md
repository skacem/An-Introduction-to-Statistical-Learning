# An Introduction to Statistical Learning

[ISL](https://www.statlearning.com) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani is considered a classic in statistical and machine learning fields and is an absolutely great way to start your analytics career.  

The book is [free to download](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) and an online course by the authors is available on [youtube](https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/) as well as on [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning) with the possibility to purchase a certificate of completion.

This repository contains my solutions to the labs and exercises, and some notes and plots from the textbook as well.
